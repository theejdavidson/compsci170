With enough fuel and supplies to get you to Canada, you hightail it the heck out of town as fast as you can.  Once you have driven miles away, you turn to look back at your hometown one last time.  You see pillars of smoke and fire rising up from where you town once stood proudly. It looks like the groups of marauding bandits were not just rumors after all.  A single tear rolls down your cheek as you reflect on the life you once had.  You turn to face the road ahead of you.  Who knows, maybe Canada won’t be so bad…
YOU WIN!
