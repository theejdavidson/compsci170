With enough fuel and supplies to get you to Canada, you hightail it out of town as fast as you can. Once you are a very miles away, you turn look back at your hometown one last time. You see pillars of smoke and fire rising up from where you town is. It looks like the groups of bandits weren’t just rumors after all. Although it’s sad to see your hometown destroyed, you are just happy you got out in time. Who knows, maybe Canada won’t be so bad…
YOU WIN!
