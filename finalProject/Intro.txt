The year is 2017 and DT-Day has occurred. That is to say, Donald Trump was elected President. Immediately following his inauguration into office, riots ensued, the government collapsed, and agriculture and industry came to a halt. Thankfully, you live in Buffalo Wyoming, a small town that was largely unaffected. However, there are rumors about a group of bandits going from town to town taking whatever they want by force. Everybody in your town has since abandoned in hopes of finding safety in Canada. Unfortunately, you missed the memo entirely and were left behind because you were too busy playing video games in your basement.  When you finally beat the level you had been stuck on, you walk outside and realize what had happened.  Your entire family has left without you.  Immediately you realize that you will need to set out to Canada on your own.  In order to survive the journey, you must gather enough food water and gas to make it to the city of Saskatoon where the rest of your family is currently staying. Each day, you can travel to one place to look for supplies. You will need 10 supply of food, 10 supply of water, and 10 supply of gas to leave town. You start with 3 supply of gas. Hurry though, your time is limited...
