You approach your local gas station. The shattered door creaks as it hangs broken on one hinge.  A single pump lies beckoning, the nozzle unhooked and swinging freely.  A small but steady trickle of sweet, sweet gasoline flows from the nozzle.  You have never seen a more beautiful potentially serious fire hazard.
