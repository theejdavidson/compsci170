You wake up day and hear a faint rumbling in the distance. As you step outside, what you see terrifies you. It is Donald Trump himself, riding a carriage pulled by Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Ted Cruz/Kevin Malone/Zodiac Killer. He is carrying a giant scythe, and if it weren’t for the orange cotton candy on his head, he would look like death himself. You see behind him the countless disciples of Trump. They all have the eyes of someone who no longer has a will of their own; they are perfect Trump soldier material. You know escape is impossible, you just wish you could have found your supplies sooner…
GAME OVER
