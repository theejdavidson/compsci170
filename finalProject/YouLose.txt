The tenth day has passed, and you are still unprepared for your journey.  You wake up in the morning and hear a faint rumbling in the distance. You confusedly step outside to the most terrifying sight you could possibly imagine. It is Donald Trump himself, riding a carriage pulled by Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and alleged Zodiac Killer/legally recognized Kevin Malone lookalike Ted Cruz.  Trump carries a giant scythe, and if not for the ridiculous yellow cotton candy strugglingly combed over his head, he would look like death himself. You see behind him the countless disciples of Trump. One look into their eyes makes it clear to you they have lost any semblance of individual will.  A second glance into their eyes tells you something far worse: they are all super racist. You realize escape is impossible and you just wish you could have found your supplies soonerâ€¦
